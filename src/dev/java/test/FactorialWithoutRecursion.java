Recursion

Recursion is a process of a method calling itself.
 
Recursion can be used to solve problems where a logic needs to executed repeatedly for a smaller set.
 
For example, we can recursion to find the factorial of number.
 
Factorial of a number, n is expressed as n! and can be calculated as :
 
n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) ï¿½ * 2 * 1
 
Lets first see how to calculate factorial without using recursion.
